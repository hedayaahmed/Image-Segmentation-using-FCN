# Image-Segmentation-using-FCN
Using Keras framework and Python3, I implement a Fully Convolutional Network "FCN" including its encoder and decoder in order to segment Indoor scenes images like bedrooms, living rooms, and dining rooms with final satisfying accuracy, loss, and Mean Intersection over Union "MIoU".
